# The Illusion of Safety: Exploiting XSS Beyond "HttpOnly" Cookies

---

## Start Here: Read the Full Write-up First!

Hey Hackers! Before you dive into the code and demo, **please read my detailed blog post** explaining the full attack chain, theory, and impact behind this lab:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://thecyberneh.github.io/posts/Exploiting+XSS+Beyond+HttpOnly+Cookies/](https://thecyberneh.github.io/posts/Exploiting+XSS+Beyond+HttpOnly+Cookies/)

This write-up covers:
- What `HttpOnly` cookies really protect
- Why many XSS bugs with HttpOnly cookies get underrated
- How storing CSRF tokens in localStorage can be abused via XSS
- The magic of chaining Stored XSS + CSRF for privilege escalation

## What Is This Repo?

This repository contains the **demo lab** I built to accompany the blog post above.

It is a **simplified web app** simulating the vulnerability and attack flow:

- Normal users upload SVG profile pictures (vulnerable to stored XSS)
- Admin views these pictures and can promote users to admin
- CSRF tokens protect sensitive actions â€” but the token is stored in localStorage, accessible via injected JavaScript
- The demo shows how an attacker can exploit this chain to **escalate from normal user to admin**

---

## Why This Matters

Many pentesters dismiss XSS with `HttpOnly` cookies as low impact because cookies canâ€™t be stolen. But this demo proves that:

- Attackers can **bypass HttpOnly protections by abusing localStorage-stored CSRF tokens**
- XSS combined with CSRF can be a potent attack chain leading to full privilege escalation
- Always scrutinize where sensitive tokens are stored and how your app protects critical actions

## How to Run This Lab Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecyberneh/xss-beyond-httponly-lab.git
cd xss-beyond-httponly-lab
npm install
```

### Launch the App

```bash
node app.js
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

On the first run, the app automatically creates the following default users if they donâ€™t already exist:

| Role         | Username | Password |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Admin        | admin    | admin    |
| Regular User | user     | pass     |

> These accounts are stored in the SQLite database (`database.db`).
> Passwords are stored in plaintext for lab purposes â€” **do not use in production**.

## Revoke Admin Rights from a User

If you promoted a non-admin user to admin and want to make them non-admin again, run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 database.db "UPDATE users SET is_admin = 0 WHERE id = 2;"
```

> Replace `2` with the actual user ID you want to demote.  
> Then restart the app with:

```bash
node app.js
```

## What You Can Do in This Lab

- Log in as a normal user and upload an SVG with a malicious XSS payload
- Log in as admin and view user profile images to trigger the XSS
- Observe how the injected JavaScript steals the CSRF token from localStorage and performs a privileged `promote-user` request
- Understand how the chained attack bypasses HttpOnly cookie protections and CSRF defenses
